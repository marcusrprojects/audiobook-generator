---

## 🚀 TL;DR Quick Start

For those familiar with Python development:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/marcusrprojects/audiobook-generator.git](https://github.com/marcusrprojects/audiobook-generator.git)
cd audiobook-generator

# 2. Create & activate virtual environment (macOS/Linux example)
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install Piper TTS packages manually first
pip install piper-tts --no-deps
pip install piper-phonemize-cross

# 4. Install the package and its other dependencies
pip install . # Installs audiobook-generator and requirements.txt deps

# 5. Download default English voice models (requires bash/curl)
bash download_voices.sh

# 6. Generate an audiobook!
audiobook-gen path/to/your_book.epub path/to/output/audio.mp3

<sub>Windows Users: Use PowerShell/CMD for venv activation (see detailed steps below). For download_voices.sh, use WSL2, Git Bash, or download models manually.</sub>
```

## 🛠 Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project and its dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marcusrprojects/audiobook-generator.git
    cd audiobook-generator
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    # macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Windows (Command Prompt)
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # Windows (PowerShell)
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

3. **Install Piper TTS Packages Manually**:
  *These specific packages often need manual installation first due to their dependencies or naming conventions.*

    ```bash
    pip install piper-tts --no-deps
    pip install piper-phonemize-cross
    ```

4. **Install the remaining dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Install the `audiobook-generator` package**:
    *This step reads `setup.py` and makes the `audiobook-gen` command available in your active environment.*

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

6. **Download voice models**:
  *See the "Downloading Voice Models" section below for details. The easiest way is using the provided script (requires `bash` and `curl`):*

    ```bash
    bash download_voices.sh
    ```
  
  *(If `bash` is unavailable, see manual download instructions below).*

> **Note:** `requirements.txt` includes all non-Piper dependencies. The two Piper packages must be installed manually due to naming differences.

## 📥 Downloading Voice Models

This tool uses **Piper TTS models** (ONNX format) for speech synthesis.

You can download free voice models from [HuggingFace Piper Voices](https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices).

### Easy method (recommended)

Run the included script:

```bash
bash download_voices.sh
```

### Manual method (example for Joe)

```bash
mkdir -p voices/en_US/joe-medium
cd voices/en_US/joe-medium
curl -L -o en_US-joe-medium.onnx \
  https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_US/joe/medium/en_US-joe-medium.onnx
curl -L -o en_US-joe-medium.onnx.json \
  https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_US/joe/medium/en_US-joe-medium.onnx.json
cd ../../../..
```

## 🌟 Usage (After Installation via `pip install .`)

Ensure your virtual environment is active (`source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate`). You can then use the audiobook-gen command:

```bash
audiobook-gen input_file.pdf output_file.mp3
```

By default, the **LibriTTS R (US, medium)** voice is used. To specify a different model:
*(Use the path to the desired `.onnx` model file)*

```bash
audiobook-gen input_file.epub output_file.wav \
  --model voices/en_GB/cori-high/en_GB-cori-high.onnx
```

Specify input format (EPUB) and output format (WAV):

```bash
audiobook-gen path/to/novel.epub final_audio.wav
```

Add metadata (MP3 only):

```bash
audiobook-gen book.txt audiobook.mp3 \
  --title "My Audiobook" --artist "Author Name"
```

List available bundled voice models:
*(Lists voices defined in the script's `AVAILABLE_VOICES` list)*

```bash
audiobook-gen --list-models
```

Show help message:
*(Displays all available command-line options)*

```bash
audiobook-gen --help
```

## 📦 Creating a Standalone Executable (Optional Alternative)

If you want to distribute this tool to users who might not have Python installed, you can bundle it into a single executable file using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/). This is typically done by the developer for distribution.

**Steps to Create the Executable:**

1. Make sure you have followed the Installation steps 1-4 (you need the dependencies installed).
2. Install PyInstaller in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

3. Run PyInstaller from the project's root directory (`audiobook-generator/`):

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile audiobook_generator.py
```

*This process can take a significant amount of time and requires substantial disk space. It analyzes dependencies and bundles everything. The final executable will be placed inside a new `dist/` folder.*

**Running the Standalone Executable:**

Once built, the executable in the `dist` folder can be run directly without needing Python or the virtual environment.

```bash
# Example on macOS/Linux:
cd dist
./audiobook_generator ../path/to/book.pdf output.mp3 --model ../voices/en_US/joe-medium/en_US-joe-medium.onnx

# Example on Windows:
cd dist
.\audiobook_generator.exe ..\path\to\book.pdf output.mp3 --model ..\voices\en_US\joe-medium\en_US-joe-medium.onnx
```

*Note: Paths to input files and models are relative to where you run the command.*
